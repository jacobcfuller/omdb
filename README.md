# Open Movie Database Search
A simple web app that uses the OMDb API to search for movies and present their
details.

## Usage
Use the search window to search via movie title. If OMDb can find it, the
movie poster and title will be displayed.

Click on the poster card to see more details about a specific movie. You can
link out to IMDb from this detail page, or return to search for different movies.

If OMDb does not have the movie, it will tell you the movie was not found.
